Residual resampling for VAR(1) model
====================================

This is an example implementation of performing _residual resampling_ for
a VAR(1) model and then compute bootstrap confidence intervals.

The method is described in Chapter 2 of "Resampling Methods for Dependent Data"
by Lahiri.
