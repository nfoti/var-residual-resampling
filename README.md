Residual resampling for VAR models
====================================

This is an example implementation of performing _residual resampling_ for
VAR models and then compute bootstrap confidence intervals.

The method is described in Chapter 2 of "Resampling Methods for Dependent Data"
by Lahiri.


Instructions
------------

1. Set up python environment: `conda-env create -f environment.yml`.

2. Activate python environment: `conda activate var-rr`.

3. Run the script: `ipython -i var1_residual_resampling.py`.
